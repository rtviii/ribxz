Assigining a negative value to the moletunnel of the dataframe to indicate that:
     - mole was unable to find the correct tunnel(0)
    - something is obviously blocking the tunnel (-1)
    - the ribosome is not canonically assembled(PTC is   fragmented/constriction site is far away from ptc)( -2)
